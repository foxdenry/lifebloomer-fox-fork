Lifebloomer Version 9.0.1
---------------
Update frame backdrop logic to support WoW 9.0. This change has not been tested for WoW classic at the time of submission, and may require additional
work to be compatible with WoW classic. It will not be set as a release build for WoW classic until this has been verified.

Also, updating version numbers to align with Retail. Not sure why this project originally broke from that convention, but we're back, baby!

Lifebloomer Version 3.5.5
---------------
Correct LibClassicDurations dependency usage introduced in 3.5.4 such that Lifebloomer no longer relies on another addon initializing this library.

Lifebloomer Version 3.5.4
---------------
Update to address Classic wow issues. It doesn't smell good, but it smells better than it used to.

Issues fixed with this revision:
- No longer attempting to determine role, as classic does not support this API.
- No longer attempting to detect focus target change, as classic does not support focus targets.
- Update duration tracking to use LibClassicDurations lib, as spell durations cannot be looked up by API in classic.

Lifebloomer Version 3.5.3
---------------
Change Frame Strata from High and Medium to Medium and Low, allowing other addon text/icons to utilize the high strata. This allows other addons that overlay text/icons on unit frames to do so.

Lifebloomer Version 3.5.2
---------------
Add Frame AutoGeneration Toggle Command

Adding a new command, that allows autogeneration of frames to be toggled. By default, autogeneration is enabled, which causes frames to be added and removed automatically. However, in the case that a user doesn't prefer this behavior, they can now disable autogeneration of frames using this toggle command. To re-enable autogeneration, the toggle command can be used.

Commands added:
- /lb ag
- /lb autogeneration

Lifebloomer Version 3.5.1
---------------
- Added an option in the appearances panel to enable class colors for health bars.

- Fixed bug that caused lifebloomer to not display correctly when a player lacked the rejuvenation spell.

- Updated UnitBuff calls to adhere to the new spec defined for patch 8.0.1.


Lifebloomer Version 3.5
---------------

- Added an option for Lifebloomer to auto manage group creation! (just like every other party/raid addon out there! lol!)
  Lifebloomer will update its frames whenever you enter a group (any party or raid) and whenever players enter or leave the group
  If you wish to disable this check the main tab of the Lifebloomer options screen
  (WoW menu -> Interface -> Select the Addons tab -> Click Lifebloomer from the side menu)
  
- Added Role Icons! Only when using the slash commands /lb p or /lb ra or auto group creation
  The command /lb sr isn't included because it's implemented in a very weird way (it wasn't me, I swear!), so improvements to it will be coming in the future
  The icons appear on the left side of each frame. >>>>>>>>>TODO: To disable or enable them, go to the "Appearance" tab of the Lifebloomer options screen.<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

>>>>>>>>>TODO: - Added an option to disable role sorting. This option is located in the main tab of the Lifebloomer options screen.<<<<<<<<<<<<<<

- Fixed a bug that could cause Lifebloomer to stop working if a member of your group had no selected talent specialization

- Fixed a bug that could cause Lifebloomer, in very specific circumstances, to move from its position after a UI reload or login.

- Fixed a bug where adding new frames while Lifebloomer was unlocked would not show the buttons next to the frames (no, it's not the same bug as last time)


Lifebloomer Version 3.4.2 (beta)
---------------

- Role sorting improvement: if a player has no assigned role, their role will be determined by their spec


Lifebloomer Version 3.4.1
---------------

- Generating party and raid frames (/lb p and /lb ra) will now sort group members by role in the following order: Tanks, Healers and then DPS
- Fixed a bug where adding new frames while Lifebloomer was locked would not hide the buttons next to the frames
- Fixed a bug that caused the Global Cooldown bar to sometimes be bigger than intended
- Added missing slash commands to the options screen
